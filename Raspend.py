#This module contains the code for controlling devices by giving output to GPIO pins.
#when the mode will be automatic we will take data from sensors and on the basis of sensor
#outout we will decide which appliances we want to turn on and which ones to turn off.
#when the mode will be manual this code will fetch data from Google Sheets given by user and give the output
#on GPIO pins accordingly.
